Clothing Classification 


As an academic application, it is proposed to solve a classification problem using the Fashion-MNIST Dataset,
 but, by way of illustration, the problem located under the following scenario will be taken: A clothing sales
 company in Colombia opens its doors again, after having experienced the consequences of the pandemic caused by
 Covid-19 in other countries and thinking about the safety of people, decides to fully automate their stores,
 their ideal is to keep contact between staff, customers and garments to a minimum, as well same as, reduce the
 time of permanence of people in the store, among all the ideas that were raised and the investments made in 
automatic storage equipment and interaction interfaces, with the aim of reducing all types of contact, one of 
them is the identification automatic garments, the staff should only be in charge of hanging all the elements 
on hooks and placing them at the entrance of the automatic storage system, to us We were hired to identify the 
garment and send a label to the system so that it can position it in the indicated section, in such a way that 
when any of the clients requires to see the garments of a section, they will only be shown the type that they 
I select; This development will reduce contact between staff and customers, since they will interact with the 
automatic storage system through an interface, which in turn reduces contact with the garments, since customers 
will not touch any garment to carry out search tasks. everything will be done by automatic visualization and will 
only be delivered to the client when he makes the decision to take it.

It is necessary that the algorithm works with the least possible error, given that, if it does not, the staff will
 have to make the corrections by entering the warehouse and changing the garment section, in addition to the fact 
that in the future the company wishes to implement new garments such as hats and accessories. , they would hire us 
to carry out the development, if there is a high success rate.
